## How to host a website for free using Github Pages in 10 easy steps?

You can host a multi-file website for free using Github Pages at yourgithubusername.github.io and if you own a domain you can customize your site's URL.

1- Go to github.com and sign up. If you already have an account, skip this step.

If you are signing up for the first time and will not customize your URL with a domain you own, please keep in mind that your Github username will be public on the internet when it becomes your website's URL.

2- Choose the free plan.

You can then choose to fill out the survey or not.

3- Check your email inbox and click on the link to verify your email address.

4- On the start page, click on "Start a project"

5- On the project creation page you will need to add a project name. Name your project yourgithubusername.github.io so that Github knows that you are making a special webpage project and it uploads your files to the user-facing URL whenever you make a change.

Example: If your username is HelloWorld, your project will be named HelloWorld.github.io

6- Make your project public and click on "Initialize this repository with a README"

7- Rename the "README.md" file to "index.html" since servers expect the main file on a website folder to be named "index.html"

8- In your new index.html file, delete the current content and replace it with the HTML code of your webpage. Add additional HTML and CSS files as you wish.

9- Commit the file.

10- Type yourgithubusername.github.io to your browser and reload the page until you see your website. Note that it might take up to 10 minutes for your website to appear.

And... voil√†! Now you have your website live on the internet.
